# BuildYourOwnWorld
This project implements pseudo-random world generation and an a* path-find algorithm in a fun pacman-like game!

Once a world is opened, the idea of the game is to find and press the world-exit-portal button and escape, all before the pesky goblins get to you. Good luck and enjoy!

You can run the program from MainKeyboard.java in byow/Core/ Take a look at the a* path find algorithm in byow/RoomVectorsStuff/ShortestPath.java Check out world generation in byow/Core/Engine.java
